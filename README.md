# Docker Image - Ansible - Debian

## Changelog

* 0.2 - Update to ansible 2.1.1.0
* 0.1 - Initial release

## Todo

* Starting from version 1.4, pip install only stable versions. The version
  released with wheezy is 1.1 (1.5 for jessie), so we have to find a way to
  update or install new versions.
